Do You Need a CS degree to became a software Engineer?



They teach on college is Outdated. They teach you the knowledge that was to be learned in the 1980s and the 90s.
Some subjects that are being tought in the college are useful like Operating Systems, Computer networks, Data Structure and Algorithm, OOP, theory of computation. etc.

But 4 years is quite a bit long to be learning this. Because in order to learn to code you need only just six months to a year. Even if you have zero knowledge of writing any code, six months to a year would be great to learn a decent amount of coding to get a job as a software engineer. 

Coding is a continuous learning process. even if you are in the job you will be still learning on the job on the projects. and this learning will never stops.

So, to become a software engineer. I don't think Computer Science degree or any degree is required to become a software engineer. 

i had some people who had zero degrees
basically no degree who just learned to
program by their own who were
self-taught and they were doing as good
of a job if not better than people who
had actually went to iits and stuff


big companies
like facebook google apple they don't
care now you can just go to their job
descriptions and look at it they will
have mentioned that either you have
you know a computer science degree or
you have relevant experience

so if until today you've
been thinking that you need to have a
computer science degree or some college
degree to become a software engineer
that's completely false especially in
2022 i don't think a degree is that
important to become a software engineer


just focus on learning real skills just
focus on learning the art of development
just get better at writing code and i
think that will be good enough

and apart
from that i think you should spend more
time learning other skills like you know
communication and critical thinking and
problem solving i think those skills are
going to do you much more good


today where i
stand i could have been here without the
degree

    Software Engineer with Commerce and BCA to Amazon:

1.5 Years worked on service based company.
Then joined on Amazon as a Software engineer.

Questions: Medium to hard Leetcode level of question.



Top Product Based company like amazon, google don't require any certification on perticular domain. or a perticular College.

But 

>>>Your resume should have that much top notch and good so that HR would accept that resume. 
They focus very much on Data Structure.

Interview ke kisi bhi round me they don't ask you about your marks or anything related to your college background and degree.


I have learnt How to implement Data Structures. and algorithm basics to hard at "Algo Expert".
Leetcode 100 Questions and
SDE Sheet.: 180 Question.

Leetcode me log 500 ya 1000 question solve kiye hote hai. But if you check my profile its just 100 Questions. So, its don't really matter how many Questions have you done. 
If you solved few questions but you have understood the logic behind the problem then it would be equivalent to that 500 questions. 
Interview me aapko sare questions solve nahi karne hote. Hardly maine 2 se 3 question khud se solve kiye poore interview me baaki question ke liye maine interviwer se help mangi thi. 

So, Thinkig out loud is more important. means you should be able to explain what you are thinking. 

so, Question ko approach karo. phir Interviewer would help at some point. Interviewer se help le kar aapko thoda idea lagega ki kis tarah se isko solve karna hai. To wo dekhna chahte hai ki "Apki Problem solving Skill" kaisi hai.
So, don't do like Question Ratt kar aao aur usko solve kar do.

AApko job ka interview de ke FREE me pata chal jaega ki aap kitne paani me hai. Aur wo bhi bata raha hai jo aapko select karega. Employer hai wo hire karega to wahi na jaanta hoga ki aapko kya jaanna chahiye aur kya nahi.


Go into linkedin and write: " I am hiring". or  "We are hiring". Aur connection me aake click kar dijiye first connection ke oopar. Linkedin wo tamam post dikha dega jinhone apne headline me likha hoga "I am hiring", or "We are hiring." Aur wo apke first connection me honge. Matlab wo banda aapko directly jaanta hai. aur wo aapko hire kar raha hai. 

To AAp agar directly Recruiter ke paas ja rahe hai. to un Recruiter ke paise bach jaenge jinko wo paisa un bando ko dena padta  jo aapko refferal dete. 

To Isliye apne connection me HR aur Recruiter ko bhi rakho. Aur un logon ko bhi rakho jo full time yahi refer karne ka aur Referral dene ka kaam kar rahe hai.

number one is standardized versus
variable process
software engineering interviews are very
standardized in fact the process is so
standardized that it pretty much follows
this formula
after you pass the resume screen the
first round is an online assessment
second round is a technical screen with
a software engineer at a company
sometimes this is subbed with a
behavioral realm it depends on the
company
and then the onsite is four to six
different interviews
there are small variations usually
depending on if you're a fresh grad or
an experienced hire
or if you're amazon and you're a little
bit cheap so you have a virtual on site
instead
but overall really uniform now on the
other hand data science interviews vary
drastically
since data science is a much newer field
there hasn't actually been as much
time to standardize the interview
process or even fully come up with the
core skill sets
of what makes a good data scientist this
is why each company will ask you
questions that they think a data
scientist should know how to perform
really well
for their specific company they're
usually at least two rounds of
interviews sometimes more
so first off there is a recruiter screen
and after that
for the first round some companies will
give you a take-home assessment
where they ask you questions about a
data set and see what kinds of insights
you can extract from it
other companies may give you an online
assessment similar to that of a software
engineer
and others might even give you a math
assessment too then there's a behavior
around
as part of a phone interview where they
might just ask you questions related to
data
for the onsite there's usually two to
six different interviews
the format and content varies a lot too

        Best Programming Language to learn Data Structure and Algorithms MySirG.com


You could implement Data Structure and algorithm with C or C++.
You should learn C Language first. Then you should learn C++ language. and do DSA on C++.

If you want to do Competitive programming on Data Structure and Algorithm. Then C++ is the ideal choice. and it is recommended.

If you implemented DSA in any language like C++, then you could defenitely implement that DSA knowledge on another programming language like Python.
Only the difference will be style would be change. Coding logic would be same, algorithms would be same. 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  How to learn Data Structure and Algorithm by MySirG.com


1. Programming Language: recommended language C or C++.

2. Algorithms Rattafication: Don't Mug up or do rattafication of Algorithms. Try to make programs on all Data Structures and make programs on all the Algorithms.

3. First Learn Programming Language: You can't learn Data Structure and Algorithm without learning Programming Language. You should get a good command on : 
    Fuction
    Array 
    Structure
    Pointer
    Dynamic memory allocation

4. Make Diagrams: Make diagrams to visualise the operation and logic and represent the data structure.

5. Time complexity: Do not bother time complexity. First become maeture on programming. 

6. Dry Run Your Code.

                  Get Into Companies without any Experience by Ayush Singh


in college you learn how to code you build your projects and then you mention all your projects which you have built in your college journey in your resume. and then after that you apply for jobs at startups or mncs. it seems normal right but what if i tell you that this is the
wrong way. then you might wonder then what is the right way. 

what are the mistakes which most people do while applying to jobs off campus.
let's start with an story of an iit guy who have applied to 450 plus companies or startups and only got replies from few startups and this was mentioned by linkedin on his post only.

i also made the same mistakes in my initial days of my career in data science i used to apply to several jobs and then just wait for the replies despite the eligibility criteria of a job description which was masters in Computer Science stream.
days were passing and i got nothing in my hand so i thought why do companies or startups will consider me over someone who did masters or a higher degrees. moment i ask this question to myself i have to find a way.

And i found a very important pattern in these company's recruitment system
which i call that as the pattern of "AUSI", which is my defined rule. 

"A"- the first one is to Apply for the roles which aligns with your skills. let's say a spotify is hiring for a data scientist role so you read and analyze the job description so after reading and
analyzing the job description. you found that they will make you work on domains like customer churn that products like ads documentation or songs documentation. if you found that this job description aligns with interest then try to make an impactful and value adding project around the product they want candidate to be working. in this case it can be recommendation system or maybe something customer churn and etc. 
then tweak your resume by adding those projects which you have built in that. this will make your resume or application creamy. but make sure that the project is solving a problem and it fully showcases your skill potential. 
this will create a huge impact between you and the random guy who is holding a particular degree. recruiter will see your project in real time and here you're showcasing what they need not what you need.
 and this will increase your chance for getting shortlisted and getting placed in your company which you want to work on.

secondly why do i even suggest you do applies for the companies where your interest lies. say for example you're interested in biotechnology so search for companies which are related to biotech and then follow the same AUSI pattern. and then apply to that job if you have any sort of experience in that field or the any kind of good projects which you have made feel free to add them in your resume. 

so what will be the benefits of it.
1. first you will be having good projects and secondly you will learn more topics if needed.
i also made into several good startups that paid me very well through this AUSI pattern and there i got a chance to grow and learn a lot. i also got in a startup named zenML  as an MLops engineer and you'll be surprised to know. that i was not having any sort of experience in MLops domain. so i searched for that company researched a bit and then i followed the AUSI pattern. by which i made a project which aligned with the company's interest. and then i tweaked my resume and then i applied for the job.
 guess what i was shortlisted for an interview and then i was selected there as an MLops engineer from the pools of application. and if you follow this path perfectly and pretty much sure that you will be also landing your own dream jobs or the jobs which you're interested in and as the quote states in three idiots movie pursue excellence successful follow hands down the only thing is that you just need to grow every day even if you grow one percent a day that is equal to 365% for an year.

4. uske baad apna background bata sakte ho. ki kaun se college se padha hai. agar institute acha nahi hai. to sirf ye batana hai. ki I have done my B.tech. and i got this much opportunity. agar percentage kam hai. to wo bhi skip kar dena hai. koi bhi negative impression nahi padna chahiye. 
Apne juban se sirf positive cheeje nikalna hai. 

5. Uske baad apne present time ke bare me batana hai. ki "corrently i am persuing my masters from IIT guahati in computer science and ingeneering". 
words ko simple rakhna hai bahut complex nahi banana hai. nahi to samne baitha aadmi bhi nahi samajh paega.

6. ab aap apna achivements dikha sakte hai. agar aapne internship wagairah kari hai to wo bhi menstion kar sakte hai. internship ke baare me batate samay ye bhi batana hai. ki waha se seekha kya hai. e.g., "I have done my internship from XYZ company. and done full stack Data science on that company. and i have learnt technologies like pytorch, scala and perl on that company and also brush up my skill of python and machine learning because we have done so many projects their related to this domain." 
kyuki company ko isse koi matlab nahi hai ki aapne internship kaha se kiya hai. uske liye important ye hai. ki apne waha se seekha kya hai. 

7. uske baat aapko batana hai. aap kis type ke personality hai. strong point aur week point ke term me nahi batana hai. kyuki aapne strong points ko batane ke baad agar agar aap apne week point nahi bhi bataenge to wo aapke week point ke baare me poochenge hi aur aap phans jaenge. 
aap bata sakte hai. mai "versetile" hu main "easy going" hun. mai "self deciplined hu" ye sirf bolna nahi hai isko show bhi karna hai. ya is point ko kaise bhi kar ke prove kar dena hai.
