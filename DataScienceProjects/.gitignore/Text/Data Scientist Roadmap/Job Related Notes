Do You Need a CS degree to became a software Engineer?



They teach on college is Outdated. They teach you the knowledge that was to be learned in the 1980s and the 90s.
Some subjects that are being tought in the college are useful like Operating Systems, Computer networks, Data Structure and Algorithm, OOP, theory of computation. etc.

But 4 years is quite a bit long to be learning this. Because in order to learn to code you need only just six months to a year. Even if you have zero knowledge of writing any code, six months to a year would be great to learn a decent amount of coding to get a job as a software engineer. 

Coding is a continuous learning process. even if you are in the job you will be still learning on the job on the projects. and this learning will never stops.

So, to become a software engineer. I don't think Computer Science degree or any degree is required to become a software engineer. 

i had some people who had zero degrees
basically no degree who just learned to
program by their own who were
self-taught and they were doing as good
of a job if not better than people who
had actually went to iits and stuff


big companies
like facebook google apple they don't
care now you can just go to their job
descriptions and look at it they will
have mentioned that either you have
you know a computer science degree or
you have relevant experience

so if until today you've
been thinking that you need to have a
computer science degree or some college
degree to become a software engineer
that's completely false especially in
2022 i don't think a degree is that
important to become a software engineer


just focus on learning real skills just
focus on learning the art of development
just get better at writing code and i
think that will be good enough

and apart
from that i think you should spend more
time learning other skills like you know
communication and critical thinking and
problem solving i think those skills are
going to do you much more good


today where i
stand i could have been here without the
degree

    Software Engineer with Commerce and BCA to Amazon:

1.5 Years worked on service based company.
Then joined on Amazon as a Software engineer.

Questions: Medium to hard Leetcode level of question.



Top Product Based company like amazon, google don't require any certification on perticular domain. or a perticular College.

But 

>>>Your resume should have that much top notch and good so that HR would accept that resume. 
They focus very much on Data Structure.

Interview ke kisi bhi round me they don't ask you about your marks or anything related to your college background and degree.


I have learnt How to implement Data Structures. and algorithm basics to hard at "Algo Expert".
Leetcode 100 Questions and
SDE Sheet.: 180 Question.

Leetcode me log 500 ya 1000 question solve kiye hote hai. But if you check my profile its just 100 Questions. So, its don't really matter how many Questions have you done. 
If you solved few questions but you have understood the logic behind the problem then it would be equivalent to that 500 questions. 
Interview me aapko sare questions solve nahi karne hote. Hardly maine 2 se 3 question khud se solve kiye poore interview me baaki question ke liye maine interviwer se help mangi thi. 

So, Thinkig out loud is more important. means you should be able to explain what you are thinking. 

so, Question ko approach karo. phir Interviewer would help at some point. Interviewer se help le kar aapko thoda idea lagega ki kis tarah se isko solve karna hai. To wo dekhna chahte hai ki "Apki Problem solving Skill" kaisi hai.
So, don't do like Question Ratt kar aao aur usko solve kar do.

3. Your unique specific skill. like Urdu, Hindi, Video Editor, Audio Editor, Explainer Video maker, Zoologist, Biology, Biology Graduate.


In USA they are not getting enough candidates and employe to hire. You could apply for a remote job.

You could also go to Soudi Arab Company.

Give Interview as soon as possible. To get feedback on what are the things you still have to learn and complete in order to get a job as a Data Scientist.

AApko job ka interview de ke FREE me pata chal jaega ki aap kitne paani me hai. Aur wo bhi bata raha hai jo aapko select karega. Employer hai wo hire karega to wahi na jaanta hoga ki aapko kya jaanna chahiye aur kya nahi.


Go into linkedin and write: " I am hiring". or  "We are hiring". Aur connection me aake click kar dijiye first connection ke oopar. Linkedin wo tamam post dikha dega jinhone apne headline me likha hoga "I am hiring", or "We are hiring." Aur wo apke first connection me honge. Matlab wo banda aapko directly jaanta hai. aur wo aapko hire kar raha hai. 

To AAp agar directly Recruiter ke paas ja rahe hai. to un Recruiter ke paise bach jaenge jinko wo paisa un bando ko dena padta  jo aapko refferal dete. 

To Isliye apne connection me HR aur Recruiter ko bhi rakho. Aur un logon ko bhi rakho jo full time yahi refer karne ka aur Referral dene ka kaam kar rahe hai.

number one is standardized versus
variable process
software engineering interviews are very
standardized in fact the process is so
standardized that it pretty much follows
this formula
after you pass the resume screen the
first round is an online assessment
second round is a technical screen with
a software engineer at a company
sometimes this is subbed with a
behavioral realm it depends on the
company
and then the onsite is four to six
different interviews
there are small variations usually
depending on if you're a fresh grad or
an experienced hire
or if you're amazon and you're a little
bit cheap so you have a virtual on site
instead
but overall really uniform now on the
other hand data science interviews vary
drastically
since data science is a much newer field
there hasn't actually been as much
time to standardize the interview
process or even fully come up with the
core skill sets
of what makes a good data scientist this
is why each company will ask you
questions that they think a data
scientist should know how to perform
really well
for their specific company they're
usually at least two rounds of
interviews sometimes more
so first off there is a recruiter screen
and after that
for the first round some companies will
give you a take-home assessment
where they ask you questions about a
data set and see what kinds of insights
you can extract from it
other companies may give you an online
assessment similar to that of a software
engineer
and others might even give you a math
assessment too then there's a behavior
around
as part of a phone interview where they
might just ask you questions related to
data
for the onsite there's usually two to
six different interviews
the format and content varies a lot too

        Best Programming Language to learn Data Structure and Algorithms MySirG.com


You could implement Data Structure and algorithm with C or C++.
You should learn C Language first. Then you should learn C++ language. and do DSA on C++.

If you want to do Competitive programming on Data Structure and Algorithm. Then C++ is the ideal choice. and it is recommended.

If you implemented DSA in any language like C++, then you could defenitely implement that DSA knowledge on another programming language like Python.
Only the difference will be style would be change. Coding logic would be same, algorithms would be same. 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  How to learn Data Structure and Algorithm by MySirG.com


1. Programming Language: recommended language C or C++.

2. Algorithms Rattafication: Don't Mug up or do rattafication of Algorithms. Try to make programs on all Data Structures and make programs on all the Algorithms.

3. First Learn Programming Language: You can't learn Data Structure and Algorithm without learning Programming Language. You should get a good command on : 
    Fuction
    Array 
    Structure
    Pointer
    Dynamic memory allocation

4. Make Diagrams: Make diagrams to visualise the operation and logic and represent the data structure.

5. Time complexity: Do not bother time complexity. First become maeture on programming. 

6. Dry Run Your Code.
