11. Set A List Of Words Per Target Group

For instance, if your target group is opinionated, the typical currency is charm. If your target group are thinkers, the currency is logic and numbers to make a point. For target groups that are meant to be inspired, try testing different images—images with one person versus images with a family, for instance—to accompany your story. - Christina Utz, CRK


14. Craft A Suspenseful Narrative

One of the best ways to keep your audience captivated is through suspense. Use a great hook and an interesting resolution that shows your audience why they should listen, watch or read all the way to the end. No matter what form of communication you use, telling your story with a suspenseful narrative will leave people engaged and wanting more. - Cynthia Sener, Chatmeter

15. Watch The Film Reservoir Dogs

My advice is watch the movie Reservoir Dogs and copy the technique used by actor Tim Roth who played the character Mr. Orange. Roth portrayed an undercover police officer who had to create a new identity down to the smallest details. He did this by telling a story over and over until he could tell the story flawlessly. I use this same technique, and it allows me to speak confidently. - Brittain Ladd, PULSE Integration
