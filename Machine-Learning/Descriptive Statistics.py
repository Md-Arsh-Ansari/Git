                        1. Descriptive Statistics Vs Inferential Statistics
          
                        
Case: HP company ko students ka data chahiye. ki students generally kis price range me Laptop khareedte hai. Taki usi price range ka laptop launch kiya jae.
    
                               1. Inferential Statistics: 
                   
    1. Population: Poora India me har ek student se poocha jae.
    2. Sample: ek perticular small group se poocha jae aur uske basis par Population ka jawab predict kiya jae. A sample is a representative group of a larger population.
    
    jab bhi kisi data ke saath kaam karenge. humko pahle identify karna padega ki ye sample hai. ya population hai. 
   " Because their are different formula for population and sample each"
    
    Sample ke liye 2 cheejo ka dhyan rakha jata hai. :
        i) Randomness: har student ka barabar chance hai data me aane ka. koi bhi student aa sakta hai.
        ii) Representative: sample me variation hona chahiye. matlab har segment se data aana chahiye. to bahut acha hai. ek yaha ek Jharkhand se, ek Delhi se, ek tamilnadu se. aise.
                            
    3. Statistics: kuch student ko uthane ke baad. un sabhi se laptop ka price pooch ke us data ka jo mean nikale wo mean "Statistics" hai. 
    "Sample ke oopar koi bhi matric draw karte hai. usko statistics kahte hai."
    
    4. Parameter: Sample ke mean se jo Population ka mean infer karne ka koshish kiye. to us Population ke mean ko parameter kahenge.
    
        Conclusion: Jo bhi matices sample se related hoga. usko statistics.
                   Aur jo bhi Population se related hoga. usko prameter kahenge.
                   
     "inferential statistics is all about choti cheej se badi cheej ke bare me inferences draw karna."
     Inferential Statistics ke under me : Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Interval jaise topics aate hai.
                            2. Descriptive Statistics:
    
Descriptive Statistics ko summary statistics bhi kahte hai. Ek given data ko summaries karne ke process ko Descriptive statistics me dekhte hai.
 e.g.,:
    mean 
    median
    mode
    varience
    Standard deviation       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                       
                                    2. Types of Data
                        
    Numerical Data 
    Categorical Data                       
                        
1. Numerical Data / Quantitative Data :  
e.g., Price of Smartphone

#Types: 
    Discrete
    Continuous

    a) Continuous Data:  Continuous data are in the form of fractional numbers. 
        e.g., #It can be the version of an android phone, the height of a person, the length of an object, etc. 
        The continuous variable can take any value within a range. 
        
    
    b) Descrete Data : Data can attain any integer value. e.g., no. of apps. : you cannot say you have 8.5 number of apps. The discrete data contain the values that fall under integers or whole numbers. 
    e.g., #The total number of students in a class is an example of discrete data. These data can’t be broken into decimal or fraction values.
    
    
2. Categorical Data / Qualitative Data :
e.g., Brand of Smartphone

# Types: 
    Nominal
    Ordinal
    
    
    a) Nominal Data: 
    These are the set of values that don’t possess a natural ordering. Let’s understand this with some examples. 
    e.g., #The color of a smartphone can be considered as a nominal data type as we can’t compare one color with others. It is not possible to state that ‘Red’ is greater than ‘Blue’. The gender of a person is another one where we can’t differentiate between male, female, or others. 
    
    b) Ordinal Data: In Ordinal categorical data, There is a order between categories. e.g., Rate about this smartphone battery in terms of : 
   Excellent, Good, Bad. 
   in this example you could easily find a order between them. like Excellent is better than good. and good is better than bad.
   These types of values have a natural ordering while maintaining their class of values. If we consider the size of a clothing brand then we can easily sort them according to their name tag in the order of small < medium < large. The grading system while marking candidates in a test can also be considered as an ordinal data type where A+ is definitely better than B grade.

                              3. Studying types of data with graphs            
                       
Numerical Data 
Categorical Data 

    
    
    #. Categorical Data / Qualitative Data : 
    some popular ways of representing categorical data: 
    Frequency tables, pie charts, and bar charts are the most appropriate graphical displays for categorical variables.

    Frequency Table
    A table containing the counts of how often each category occurs.

    Pie chart
    Graphical representation for categorical data in which a circle is partitioned into “slices” on the basis of the proportions of each category.

    Bar chart
    Graphical representation for categorical data in which vertical (or sometimes horizontal) bars are used to depict the number of experimental units in each category; bars are separated by space.
    
    
        #NewWays of Representing: 
        1. Bar plot
    Let’s start with the most classical way of displaying categorical data: a bar plot that doesn’t even need an introduction.

        2. Word cloud
    
    
    #Numerical Data / Quantitative Data: 
    1. bar graph
    2. histogram
    3. pie chart
    4. Line graph
    5. Frequency Distribution
    6. Scatter Plot
    7. Line plot
    8. Box and Whisker Plot

                            Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency                


    Outliers : 
Outliers effect mean a lot. while outliers does not effect median. 
    So, it is safe to use median to measure the central tendency of the data. if data have some outliers.
    and if data have lot of outliers like more than half of the value in your data are outliers. then Median also get effected and its start giving you inappropriate value.
    
    
#So, when should you use Mean, Meadian and Mode in your data Analysis process: 

"Whenever you use them, Never use only one or two of them. Use all 3 of them to get a fair idea of the centrality of the data."
