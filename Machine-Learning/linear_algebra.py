"Vector Addition" and "Multiplication by numbers" will play an important role throughout linear algebra.


when anyone talk about a vector. think about an arrow inside of a coordinate system for example x y plane. with the tail with its tail sitting at the origin. it will be always rooted from the origin. 
and if the vector is in written format then The first number or upper most number will denote the position in the x-axis and the second number or below of the upper most number will denote the position in the y-axis. and if it has 3 numbers then the third number will denote the position in the z-axis. 


#Linear Transformation:

    linear transformations are a way to move around space such that the grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced and such that the origin remains fixed.

    Delightfully,
    these transformations can be described using only a handful of numbers: 
        The coordinates of where each basis vector lands.


#Matrix Multiplication: 
    Matrices give us a language to describe these transformations where the columns represent those coordinates and matrix-vector multiplication is just a way to compute what that transformation does to a given vector.

The important take-away here is that,
every time you see a matrix,
you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space.
Once you really digest this idea,
you're' in a great position to understand linear algebra deeply.



I#agon Vector and Iagon Values:
    Anytime a matrix has 0's' everywhere other than the diagonal, it's' called, reasonably enough, a 'diagonal matrix'.
    And the way to interpret this is that:
    all the basis vectors are eigenvectors means all zero and all diagoan values, with the diagonal entries of this matrix being their eigenvalues( means numbers on the diagonal axis 5 etc).
